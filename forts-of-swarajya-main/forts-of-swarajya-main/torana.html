         Raigad Fort, a formidable hill fort in Maharashtra's Sahyadri mountains,
          served as the capital of the Maratha Empire under Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,
           who was crowned here in 1674. Known for its strategic importance,
            it features grand gateways like Maha Darwaja, royal palaces, a mint, water reservoirs, 
            and the Jagdishwar Temple, accessible via about 1,700 steps or a ropeway.
             The fort showcases Maratha architectural brilliance with bastions, ramparts, 
             and fortifications, offering panoramic views and symbolizing Maratha pride and resilience.
