            <p>
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was a brave and intelligent king who built
                a strong empire with discipline, courage, and respect for people.
                His forts are symbols of strength, strategy, and pride of Maharashtra.
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was a Maratha warrior and founding ruler
                of the Maratha empire in western India. In India and even in other countries,
                he is still considered the greatest warrior of his time. An innovative military tactician 
                and a skilful administrator, he is considered a valorous warrior. 
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the Maratha ruler, along with his 
                chief engineer Hiroji Indulkar, did the construction and 
                development of various buildings and structures, including Raigad.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was a just ruler who championed women's rights, practiced religious tolerance,
                and created a strong navy. While Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj didn't have
                one single ubiquitous slogan, his most famous rallying cry and motto,
                often shouted with immense pride, is "Jai Bhavani, Jai Shivaji!" (Hail Bhavani, Hail Shivaji!),
                invoking the warrior goddess Bhavani and himself as a symbol of Maratha strength and Swarajya (self-rule).
                Other powerful sayings attributed to him emphasize self-confidence, courage, and nation-building, 
                such as "Never bend your head, always hold it high" and "When your resolve is firm, even a mountain looks like a pile of clay."
